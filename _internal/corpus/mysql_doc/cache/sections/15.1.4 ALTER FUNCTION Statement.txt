15.1.4 ALTER FUNCTION Statement
ALTER FUNCTION func_name [characteristic ...]
characteristic: {
    COMMENT 'string'
  | LANGUAGE SQL
  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }
  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }
}
This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a stored function. More than one change
may be specified in an ALTER FUNCTION statement. However, you cannot change the parameters or
body of a stored function using this statement; to make such changes, you must drop and re-create the
function using DROP FUNCTION and CREATE FUNCTION.
You must have the ALTER ROUTINE privilege for the function. (That privilege is granted automatically
to the function creator.) If binary logging is enabled, the ALTER FUNCTION statement might also
require the SUPER privilege, as described in Section 27.8, “Stored Program Binary Logging”.
