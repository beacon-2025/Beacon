15.1.30 DROP SERVER Statement
DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] server_name
Drops the server definition for the server named server_name. The corresponding row in the
mysql.servers table is deleted. This statement requires the SUPER privilege.
Dropping a server for a table does not affect any FEDERATED tables that used this connection
information when they were created. See Section 15.1.18, “CREATE SERVER Statement”.
DROP SERVER causes an implicit commit. See Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit
Commit”.
DROP SERVER is not written to the binary log, regardless of the logging format that is in use.
