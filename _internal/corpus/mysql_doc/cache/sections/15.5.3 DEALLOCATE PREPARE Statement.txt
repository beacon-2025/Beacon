15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement
{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name
To deallocate a prepared statement produced with PREPARE, use a DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement
that refers to the prepared statement name. Attempting to execute a prepared statement after
deallocating it results in an error. If too many prepared statements are created and not deallocated by
either the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement or the end of the session, you might encounter the upper
limit enforced by the max_prepared_stmt_count system variable.
For examples, see Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”.
