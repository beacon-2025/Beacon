15.1.11 ALTER VIEW Statement
ALTER
    [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]
    [DEFINER = user]
    [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]
    VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
    AS select_statement
    [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]
This statement changes the definition of a view, which must exist. The syntax is similar to that for
CREATE VIEW see Section 15.1.23, “CREATE VIEW Statement”). This statement requires the CREATE
VIEW and DROP privileges for the view, and some privilege for each column referred to in the SELECT
statement. ALTER VIEW is permitted only to the definer or users with the SET_ANY_DEFINER or
ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_DEFINER privilege.
