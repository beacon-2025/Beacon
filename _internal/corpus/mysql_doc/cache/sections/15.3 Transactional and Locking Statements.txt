15.3 Transactional and Locking Statements
MySQL supports local transactions (within a given client session) through statements such as SET
autocommit, START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK. See Section 15.3.1, “START
TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements”. XA transaction support enables MySQL to
participate in distributed transactions as well. See Section 15.3.8, “XA Transactions”.
