15.6 Compound Statement Syntax
This section describes the syntax for the BEGIN ... END compound statement and other statements
that can be used in the body of stored programs: Stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
events. These objects are defined in terms of SQL code that is stored on the server for later invocation
(see Chapter 27, Stored Objects).
A compound statement is a block that can contain other blocks; declarations for variables, condition
handlers, and cursors; and flow control constructs such as loops and conditional tests.
