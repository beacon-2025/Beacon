15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS]
    view_name [, view_name] ...
    [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
DROP VIEW removes one or more views. You must have the DROP privilege for each view.
If any views named in the argument list do not exist, the statement fails with an error indicating by
name which nonexisting views it was unable to drop, and no changes are made.
The IF EXISTS clause prevents an error from occurring for views that don't exist. When this clause
is given, a NOTE is generated for each nonexistent view. See Section 15.7.7.41, “SHOW WARNINGS
Statement”.
RESTRICT and CASCADE, if given, are parsed and ignored.
