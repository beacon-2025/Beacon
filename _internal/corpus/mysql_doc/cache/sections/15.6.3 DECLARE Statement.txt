15.6.3 DECLARE Statement
The DECLARE statement is used to define various items local to a program:
• Local variables. See Section 15.6.4, “Variables in Stored Programs”.
• Conditions and handlers. See Section 15.6.7, “Condition Handling”.
• Cursors. See Section 15.6.6, “Cursors”.
DECLARE is permitted only inside a BEGIN ... END compound statement and must be at its start,
before any other statements.
Declarations must follow a certain order. Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations.
Variable and condition declarations must appear before cursor or handler declarations.
