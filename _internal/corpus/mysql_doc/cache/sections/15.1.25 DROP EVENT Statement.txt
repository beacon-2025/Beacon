15.1.25 DROP EVENT Statement
DROP EVENT [IF EXISTS] event_name
This statement drops the event named event_name. The event immediately ceases being active, and
is deleted completely from the server.
If the event does not exist, the error ERROR 1517 (HY000): Unknown event 'event_name'
results. You can override this and cause the statement to generate a warning for nonexistent events
instead using IF EXISTS.
This statement requires the EVENT privilege for the schema to which the event to be dropped belongs.
