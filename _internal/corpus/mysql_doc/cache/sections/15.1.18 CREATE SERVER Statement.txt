15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement
CREATE SERVER server_name
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER wrapper_name
    OPTIONS (option [, option] ...)
option: {
    HOST character-literal
  | DATABASE character-literal
  | USER character-literal
  | PASSWORD character-literal
  | SOCKET character-literal
  | OWNER character-literal
  | PORT numeric-literal
}
This statement creates the definition of a server for use with the FEDERATED storage engine. The
CREATE SERVER statement creates a new row in the servers table in the mysql database. This
statement requires the SUPER privilege.
The server_name should be a unique reference to the server. Server definitions are global within
the scope of the server, it is not possible to qualify the server definition to a specific database.
server_name has a maximum length of 64 characters (names longer than 64 characters are silently
truncated), and is case-insensitive. You may specify the name as a quoted string.
The wrapper_name is an identifier and may be quoted with single quotation marks.
For each option you must specify either a character literal or numeric literal. Character literals are
UTF-8, support a maximum length of 64 characters and default to a blank (empty) string. String literals
are silently truncated to 64 characters. Numeric literals must be a number between 0 and 9999, default
value is 0.
Note
The OWNER option is currently not applied, and has no effect on the ownership
or operation of the server connection that is created.
The CREATE SERVER statement creates an entry in the mysql.servers table that can later be used
with the CREATE TABLE statement when creating a FEDERATED table. The options that you specify
are used to populate the columns in the mysql.servers table. The table columns are Server_name,
Host, Db, Username, Password, Port and Socket.
For example:
CREATE SERVER s
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql
OPTIONS (USER 'Remote', HOST '198.51.100.106', DATABASE 'test');
Be sure to specify all options necessary to establish a connection to the server. The user name, host
name, and database name are mandatory. Other options might be required as well, such as password.
The data stored in the table can be used when creating a connection to a FEDERATED table:
CREATE TABLE t (s1 INT) ENGINE=FEDERATED CONNECTION='s';
For more information, see Section 18.8, “The FEDERATED Storage Engine”.
CREATE SERVER causes an implicit commit. See Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit
Commit”.
CREATE SERVER is not written to the binary log, regardless of the logging format that is in use.
