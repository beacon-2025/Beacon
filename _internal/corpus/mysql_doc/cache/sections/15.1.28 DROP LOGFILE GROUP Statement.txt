15.1.28 DROP LOGFILE GROUP Statement
DROP LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    ENGINE [=] engine_name
This statement drops the log file group named logfile_group. The log file group must already
exist or an error results. (For information on creating log file groups, see Section 15.1.16, “CREATE
LOGFILE GROUP Statement”.)
Important
Before dropping a log file group, you must drop all tablespaces that use that log
file group for UNDO logging.
The required ENGINE clause provides the name of the storage engine used by the log file group to be
dropped. The only permitted values for engine_name are NDB and NDBCLUSTER.
DROP LOGFILE GROUP is useful only with Disk Data storage for NDB Cluster. See Section 25.6.11,
“NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”.
