15.8.3 HELP Statement
HELP 'search_string'
The HELP statement returns online information from the MySQL Reference Manual. Its proper
operation requires that the help tables in the mysql database be initialized with help topic information
(see Section 7.1.17, “Server-Side Help Support”).
The HELP statement searches the help tables for the given search string and displays the result of the
search. The search string is not case-sensitive.
The search string can contain the wildcard characters % and _. These have the same meaning as for
pattern-matching operations performed with the LIKE operator. For example, HELP 'rep%' returns a
list of topics that begin with rep.
The HELP statement does not require a terminator such as ; or \G.
The HELP statement understands several types of search strings:
• At the most general level, use contents to retrieve a list of the top-level help categories:
HELP 'contents'
• For a list of topics in a given help category, such as Data Types, use the category name:
HELP 'data types'
• For help on a specific help topic, such as the ASCII() function or the CREATE TABLE statement,
use the associated keyword or keywords:
HELP 'ascii'
HELP 'create table'
In other words, the search string matches a category, many topics, or a single topic. The following
descriptions indicate the forms that the result set can take.
• Empty resulte
No match could be found for the search string.
Example: HELP 'fake'
Yields:
Nothing found
Please try to run 'help contents' for a list of all accessible topics
• Result set containing a single row
This means that the search string yielded a hit for the help topic. The result includes the following
items:
• name: The topic name.
• description: Descriptive help text for the topic.
• example: One or more usage examples. (May be empty.)
Example: HELP 'log'
Yields:
Name: 'LOG'
Description:
Syntax:
LOG(X), LOG(B,X)
If called with one parameter, this function returns the natural
logarithm of X. If X is less than or equal to 0.0E0, the function
returns NULL and a warning "Invalid argument for logarithm" is
reported. Returns NULL if X or B is NULL.
The inverse of this function (when called with a single argument) is
the EXP() function.

Examples:
mysql> SELECT LOG(2);
        -> 0.69314718055995
mysql> SELECT LOG(-2);
        -> NULL
• List of topics.
This means that the search string matched multiple help topics.
Example: HELP 'status'
Yields:
Many help items for your request exist.
To make a more specific request, please type 'help <item>',
where <item> is one of the following topics:
   FLUSH
   SHOW
   SHOW BINARY LOG STATUS
   SHOW ENGINE
   SHOW FUNCTION STATUS
   SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS
   SHOW REPLICA STATUS
   SHOW STATUS
   SHOW TABLE STATUS
• List of topics.
A list is also displayed if the search string matches a category.
Example: HELP 'functions'
Yields:
You asked for help about help category: "Functions"
