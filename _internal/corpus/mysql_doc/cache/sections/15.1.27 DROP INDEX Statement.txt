15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement
DROP INDEX index_name ON tbl_name
    [algorithm_option | lock_option] ...
algorithm_option:
    ALGORITHM [=] {DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY}
lock_option:
    LOCK [=] {DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE}
DROP INDEX drops the index named index_name from the table tbl_name. This statement is
mapped to an ALTER TABLE statement to drop the index. See Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE
Statement”.
To drop a primary key, the index name is always PRIMARY, which must be specified as a quoted
identifier because PRIMARY is a reserved word:
DROP INDEX `PRIMARY` ON t;
Indexes on variable-width columns of NDB tables are dropped online; that is, without any table copying.
The table is not locked against access from other NDB Cluster API nodes, although it is locked against
other operations on the same API node for the duration of the operation. This is done automatically by
the server whenever it determines that it is possible to do so; you do not have to use any special SQL
syntax or server options to cause it to happen.
ALGORITHM and LOCK clauses may be given to influence the table copying method and level of
concurrency for reading and writing the table while its indexes are being modified. They have the
same meaning as for the ALTER TABLE statement. For more information, see Section 15.1.9, “ALTER
TABLE Statement”
MySQL NDB Cluster supports online operations using the same ALGORITHM=INPLACE syntax
supported in the standard MySQL Server. See Section 25.6.12, “Online Operations with ALTER TABLE
in NDB Cluster”, for more information.
