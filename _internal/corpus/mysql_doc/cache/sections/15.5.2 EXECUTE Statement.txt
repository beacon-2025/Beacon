15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement
EXECUTE stmt_name
    [USING @var_name [, @var_name] ...]
After preparing a statement with PREPARE, you execute it with an EXECUTE statement that refers to
the prepared statement name. If the prepared statement contains any parameter markers, you must
supply a USING clause that lists user variables containing the values to be bound to the parameters.
Parameter values can be supplied only by user variables, and the USING clause must name exactly as
many variables as the number of parameter markers in the statement.
You can execute a given prepared statement multiple times, passing different variables to it or setting
the variables to different values before each execution.
For examples, see Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”.
