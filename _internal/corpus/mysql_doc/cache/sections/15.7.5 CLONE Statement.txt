15.7.5 CLONE Statement
CLONE clone_action
clone_action: {
    LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir';
  | INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'host':port
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
    [DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir']
    [REQUIRE [NO] SSL]
}
The CLONE statement is used to clone data locally or from a remote MySQL server instance. To use
CLONE syntax, the clone plugin must be installed. See Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”.
CLONE LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY syntax clones data from the local MySQL data directory to a
directory on the same server or node where the MySQL server instance runs. The 'clone_dir'
directory is the full path of the local directory that data is cloned to. An absolute path is required.
The specified directory must not exist, but the specified path must be an existent path. The MySQL
server requires the necessary write access to create the specified directory. For more information, see
Section 7.6.7.2, “Cloning Data Locally”.
CLONE INSTANCE syntax clones data from a remote MySQL server instance (the donor) and transfers
it to the MySQL instance where the cloning operation was initiated (the recipient).
• user is the clone user on the donor MySQL server instance.
• host is the hostname address of the donor MySQL server instance. Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6) address format is not supported. An alias to the IPv6 address can be used instead. An IPv4
address can be used as is.
• port is the port number of the donor MySQL server instance. (The X Protocol port specified by
mysqlx_port is not supported. Connecting to the donor MySQL server instance through MySQL
Router is also not supported.)
• IDENTIFIED BY 'password' specifies the password of the clone user on the donor MySQL
server instance.
• DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir' is an optional clause used to specify a directory on the
recipient for the data you are cloning. Use this option if you do not want to remove existing data
in the recipient data directory. An absolute path is required, and the directory must not exist. The
MySQL server must have the necessary write access to create the directory.
When the optional DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir' clause is not used, a cloning operation
removes existing data in the recipient data directory, replaces it with the cloned data, and
automatically restarts the server afterward.
• [REQUIRE [NO] SSL] explicitly specifies whether an encrypted connection is to be used or not
when transferring cloned data over the network. An error is returned if the explicit specification
cannot be satisfied. If an SSL clause is not specified, clone attempts to establish an encrypted
connection by default, falling back to an insecure connection if the secure connection attempt fails.
A secure connection is required when cloning encrypted data regardless of whether this clause is
specified. For more information, see Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning.
For additional information about cloning data from a remote MySQL server instance, see
Section 7.6.7.3, “Cloning Remote Data”.
