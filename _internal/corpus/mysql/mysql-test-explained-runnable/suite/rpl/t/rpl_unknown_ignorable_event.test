# Bug#19949915  IGNORABLE EVENTS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT TESTED
#
# Problem:
#  In 5.6, Ignorable log events were introduced. These events have
#  the flag LOG_EVENT_IGNORABLE_F flag (0x80) set in the flags field.
#  When the server (specifically, the replication receiver and applier
#  threads) sees an event with a type code it does not recognize, the
#  server is supposed to check if this flag is set. If the flag is not
#  set, the server generates an error and stops
