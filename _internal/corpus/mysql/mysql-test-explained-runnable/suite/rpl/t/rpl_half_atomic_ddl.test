# ==== Purpose ====
# Like rpl_atomic_ddl.test this test file
# proves successful slave service recovery after a simulated failure
# at handling recoverable DDL queries.
# The "half" atomic cases include those DDL statements that can not
# roll back. Once this feature is implemented for a statement it can
# merged with the fully atomic ones of rpl_atomic_ddl.test.
# See rpl_atomic_ddl.test for more info.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Mostly follows rpl_atomic_ddl.test.
# Difference is in that the slave does not try to simulate
# a failure before binary logging stage has been completed. That is
# only SET @@GLOBAL.debug="+d,crash_commit_after_log" and
# pre_binlog_check, see below commented, is not used.

# === Limitations ===
# --force-restart is required to run the test.
#
# When the object deletion was interrupted by crash
# there could be errors on object recreation attempt like
# 1007: Can't create database '...'
