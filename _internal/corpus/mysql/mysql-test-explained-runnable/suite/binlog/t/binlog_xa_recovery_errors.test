# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The purpose of this test is to check that the XA recovery identifies
# and reports errors returned by the SEs.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. An error message describing the transaction and the error will be
#     outputted to the server log.
# R2. Server will abort if any pending transaction fails to finish in the
#     SE.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# For each of the possible errors(1) returned by the SE and for each of the
# possible actions(2) performed by the SE:
# 1. Start the transaction and insert some record.
# 2. Setup a conditional sync point for timestamp for the statement
#    associated with the one of the possible SE actions(2) and execute up
#    until that sync point.
# 3. Kill the server.
# 4. Restart server passing debug symbols that will simulate SEs returning
#    a given error(1) and expect crash during start.
# 5. Find in the server log the error message corresponding to the
#    simulated error(1).
# 6. Restart the server without the debug symbols.
#
# (1) List of possible errors returned by the SE:
# - XAER_ASYNC
# - XAER_RMERR
# - XAER_NOTA
# - XAER_INVAL
# - XAER_PROTO
# - XAER_RMFAIL
# - XAER_DUPID
# - XAER_OUTSIDE
#
# (2) List of possible SE actions during recovery:
# - Commit a normal transaction
# - Rollback a normal transaction
# - Prepare an XA transaction
# - Commit an XA transaction
# - Rollback an XA transaction
# - Commit an XA transaction with one-phase
