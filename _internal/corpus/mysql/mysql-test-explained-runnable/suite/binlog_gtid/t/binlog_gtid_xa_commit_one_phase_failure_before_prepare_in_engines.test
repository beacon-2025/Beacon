# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script tests server behavior when a crash occurs during the
# execution of `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE` and just before engines start
# preparing the transaction.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# After server restart:
# R1. The `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE` statement shouldn't be logged to the binlog.
# R2. There shouldn't be any changes to GTID_EXECUTED.
# R3. There shouldn't be any pending XA transactions visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Setup scenario: create table and insert some records.
# 2. Start and execute an XA transaction containing an insert until before
#    `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE`.
# 3. Take the `GTID_EXECUTED` state.
# 4. Crash the server during `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE` execution, just
#    before storage engines start preparing.
# 5. Restart server and check:
#    a. Error log for messages stating that SE recovery process rolled back
#       a pending transaction.
#    b. Error log for messages stating that XA recovery process didn't find
#       any transaction needing recovery.
#    c. The `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE` wasn't logged to the binary log.
#    d. There aren't any changes to GTID_EXECUTED.
#    e. There aren't any pending XA transaction listed in the output of `XA
#       RECOVER`.
#    f. There aren't changes to the table.
