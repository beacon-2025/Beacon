# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The purpose of this test is to check that the binlog recovery identifies
# and reports malformed binary log files which hold invalid sequence of
# events.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. When the sequence of events found in the binary log, at recovery,
#     isn't the expected one, the server will report the issue through the
#     error log.
# R2. Finding an Xid_log_event after a sequence of events that represent a
#     finished (committed or rolled back) transaction must report an error
#     to the error log.
# R3. Finding an XA_prepare_log_event after a sequence of events that
#     represent a finished (committed or rolled back) transaction must
#     report an error to the error log.
# R4. Finding an XA_prepare_log_event holding an XID that was previously
#     found in the binary log and hasn't been yet used with `XA
#     COMMIT/ROLLBACK` must report an error to the error log.
# R5. Finding a Query_log_event containing a `BEGIN/XA START` after a
#     sequence of events that represent an ongoing transaction must report
#     an error to the error log.
# R6. Finding a Query_log_event containing a `COMMIT` after a sequence of
#     events that represent a finished (committed or rolled back)
#     transaction must report an error to the error log.
# R7. Finding a Query_log_event containing a `ROLLBACK` after a sequence of
#     events that represent a finished (committed or rolled back)
#     transaction must report an error to the error log.
# R8. Finding a Query_log_event containing a DDL after a sequence of events
#     that represent a finished (committed or rolled back) transaction must
#     report an error to the error log.
# R9. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA COMMIT` after a sequence
#     of events that represent a finished (committed or rolled back)
#     transaction must report an error to the error log.
# R10. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA COMMIT` holding an XID
#      that was previously found in the binary log and hasn't been yet used
#      with `XA PREPARE` must report an error to the error log.
# R11. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA COMMIT` holding an XID
#      that doesn't conform with the standard format of an XID, must report
#      an error to the error log.
# R12. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA ROLLBACK` after a
#      sequence of events that represent a finished (committed or rolled
#      back) transaction must report an error to the error log.
# R13. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA ROLLBACK` holding an XID
#      that was previously found in the binary log and hasn't been yet used
#      with `XA PREPARE` must report an error to the error log.
# R14. Finding a Query_log_event containing an `XA ROLLBACK` holding an XID
#      that doesn't conform with the standard format of an XID, must report
#      an error to the error log.
