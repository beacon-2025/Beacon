# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script tests server behavior when a crash occurs during the
# execution of `XA COMMIT`, just before the statement is logged to the
# binary log.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# After server restart:
# R1. The `XA COMMIT` statement shouldn't be found in the binlog.
# R2. There shouldn't be any changes to GTID_EXECUTED.
# R3. There should be one pending XA transactions visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Setup scenario: create table and insert some records.
# 2. Start and execute an XA transaction containing an insert until before
#    `XA COMMIT`.
# 3. Take the `GTID_EXECUTED` state.
# 4. Crash the server during `XA COMMIT` execution before writing to the
#    binary log.
# 5. Restart server and check:
#    a. Error log for messages stating that recovery process found one
#       transaction needing recovery.
#    b. The `XA PREPARE` is found and `XA COMMIT` isn't found in the binary
#       log.
#    c. The GTID_EXECUTED variable wasn't updated.
#    d. There is one pending XA transaction listed in the output of `XA
#       RECOVER`.
#    e. There aren't changes to the table.
# 6. Restart the server and check, again, that the XA transaction is still
#    in prepared state.
# 7. Commit the transaction.
# 8. Check the table has changed.
