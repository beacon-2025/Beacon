# Bug#30102: rename table does corrupt tables with partition files on failure
# This test case renames the table such that the partition file name 
# is 255 chars long. Due the restriction of 260 char path name (including drive label)
# this will fail in windows.

CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT)
PARTITION BY RANGE (a)
(PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (6),
 PARTITION `p1....................` VALUES LESS THAN (9),
 PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE)
